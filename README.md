# Protein-Structure-Predicition
This Repository contains a python script develpoed to predict the protien structure using the ESMFold model.
**What is a Protein ?
Proteins are biomolecules that play a crucial role in driving nearly every biological process, essential for the proper functioning and survival of all living organisms. They are made up of a linear chain of amino acid residues. Its sequence defines its chemical properties, stability, and function. A protein sequence is defined by a gene, and this sequence determines how the chain will fold, which in turn determines its properties and role.The reason why protein folding is so important is that it is closely related to protein functions. Being able to create accurate folds allows us to develop or improve drugs to treat diseases, enzymes that break down waste, or biosensors that detect environmental contaminants, and understand protein-related diseases.
# AI models for protein folding predictions
Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM) was released one year after AlphaFold-2. ESM has a variety of trained models such as ESMFold (protein folding) and ESM-2 (general-purpose model to predict structure, function, and other properties from sequences), ESM-IF1 (Inverse folding), and others.<br>
**According to Metaâ€™s blog, ESMFold can make predictions 60 times faster than the state-of-the-art model (AlphaFold-2)

# Working of ESMFold :
1. Input Data: ESMFold takes multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of a target protein sequence as input. These MSAs contain evolutionary information derived from related protein sequences.<br>
2. Evolutionary Information Encoding: It encodes the evolutionary information from the MSAs using a pretrained model. This encoding captures residue-residue interactions and evolutionary couplings.<br>
3. Attention Mechanism: ESMFold uses an attention mechanism to focus on relevant parts of the input sequences during the prediction process. This allows the model to weigh the importance of different residues in the alignment.<br>
4. Iterative Refinement: It iteratively refines the initial protein structure prediction using the encoded evolutionary information and attention mechanism. This iterative process helps improve the accuracy of the final structure prediction.<br>
5. Deep Learning Architecture: ESMFold employs a deep learning architecture, likely based on neural networks, to learn the complex relationships between sequence data and protein structures.<br>
6. Training: The model is trained on a large dataset of protein sequences and their experimentally determined structures. During training, it learns to predict accurate protein structures by minimizing the difference between predicted and experimental structures.<br>
Output: The output of ESMFold is a predicted 3D structure of the target protein sequence, represented in terms of coordinates of atoms in space. This predicted structure provides valuable insights into the protein's function and potential interactions with other molecules.
